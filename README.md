# project 'tiberius'
This project is the updated successor to **'thig-server-build-scripts'** and includes build routines for cloud providers such as AWS and also on-prem VMWare builds.

# Notes
1. This repository of scripts is intended to be used during the first-boot build routine of a virtual server start-up (be that in the AWS cloud or on a VMWare Host on-premisis) which would execute all scripts with elevated privileges. All scripts can be written assuming root privileges.
